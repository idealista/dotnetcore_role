This ansible role installs [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian) packages in a Debian environment (by default, it installs aspnetcore-runtime, but you can use this role for installing dotnetcore-runtime, sdk, etc). It has been tested for the following Debian versions:
* Stretch
* Buster

This role has been generated using the [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) tool, you can generate a similar role that fits your needs using the this [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/idealista/cookiecutter-ansible-role).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install .NET Core in a Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.9.19 version installed.

Molecule 3.x.x version installed.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver and [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) as verifier.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: idealista.dotnetcore_role
  version: 1.0.0
  name: dotnetcore_role
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: dotnetcore_role
```
